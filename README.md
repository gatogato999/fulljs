## Guide Structure

Each chapter is contained within its own numbered subfolder (e.g., `01_introduction`). Inside each chapter folder, you will find the following files:

- **`<chapter-number>_<chapter-title>.md`**: The main chapter content, covering theoretical concepts, code examples, and professional topics like testing, clean code, performance, security, and architecture.
- **`exercises.md`**: A list of hands-on, practical exercises relevant to real-world back-end and mobile full-stack scenarios.
- **`solutions.md`**: Clear, commented solutions to every exercise in `exercises.md`, following professional best practices (testing, clean code, security, Big-O analysis, optimization).
- **`leetcode.md`**: Curated LeetCode-style algorithm and data-structure problems, including problem statements, example inputs/outputs, and complete, optimized solutions with Big-O annotations.

## How to Use This Guide

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get a copy of this repository to your local machine.
